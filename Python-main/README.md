This is a repository for me to learn Python

The structure of the repository is mainly to follow this course in Udemy:
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/ 

I have dealt with python before when I was writing scripts and playing around with Django previously, 
so this course is basically a refresher + learning more stuff for me.

The way of how I approach the course will be
  1. I will try on my own (sometimes with the starting file the lecturer have provided) to code the program that is displayed in the video 
     before looking at lecturer's answer.
     
     So do not be surprised if my answer is totally different from lecturer's.
     
  2. For some projects, I will have a ks_ in front of the file to indicate that this is my code file for that particular lesson for the day.
     After I had finish my code and verified that it is working properly, I will then go through the answers and see what did I missed for the program.
     
     Then I will do a code revision with the _revised at the end to indicate this is the revised version of my code.
